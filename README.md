# Description
Firmware for ESP32-S3 that creates a rogue Wi-Fi AP with MAC spoofing, DNS hijacking, and web control. Designed for headless use in security research, CTFs, and IoT testing. Built with ESP-IDF and supports modular extensions.

Microcontroller : ESP32-S3-N16R8 /  DevKitC




ESP32-S3Rogue: Rogue Access Point + DNS Hijacker + MAC Spoofer
ESP32-S3Rogue is a proof-of-concept firmware for the ESP32-S3 that turns the device into a powerful rogue access point. 

It supports:
- Rogue Wi-Fi AP creation with custom SSID
- MAC address spoofing from UART input
- DNS hijacking to redirect all DNS queries to a fake IP
- Integrated web server for control or phishing (optional)
- LED indicator for live status
- Designed for headless operation â€” no buttons or screens needed

# How-to:
# Combine Deauther Device for completing the Evil Twin Ops.
- Flahing with VS Code PlatformIO
- App were built with ESP-IDF Framework
- Keep the CMakeLists.txt unedited (Baud should be 115200)
- Once flashed, it require you to enter MAC Address to be spoofed:
  Ignore to maintain ESP32 Default MAC by pressing Enter.
- Monitoring using UART Serial Monitor
- Optional : You can use another project like Deauther to support your WiFi Attack.

# Important Note for depricate Libraries etc ..
-  esp_vfs_dev_uart_use_driver
-  esp_netif_nat.h (Have been removed from ESP-IDF v5.3.3)

# Use Cases (for education and research only)
- Ethical hacking labs
- Wi-Fi penetration testing
- IoT/embedded security demonstrations with Microcontroller

Future Development:
- Implementing NAT Routing to prove the Evil Twin Concept.
